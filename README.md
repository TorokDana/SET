# JavaScriptDemo

For anywhom who is interested in a quick demo of my skills. Please keep in mind, that i'm only a university student, without any work experience.
You can take a glance at my code right here, or can see the whole thing if you download the zip file.
(The premade zip contains additional pictures that you will need)

This project is a representation of the cardgame:SET. I use pictures as the cards so they are not dynamically generated.
This is a simplfied version where the cards have only three categories of features.
